# Netcat Build in Python

## Overview
Netcat is a versatile networking utility that reads and writes data across network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol. This Python version of Netcat, named Netbyte, offers similar functionality to the traditional Netcat tool. It facilitates probing proprietary TCP and UDP services, providing formatted output and supporting interactive communication.

## Features
- **Lightweight**: Netbyte is designed to be lightweight, making it efficient for various networking tasks.
- **Interactive**: Users can interact with network services in real-time, allowing for dynamic communication.
- **TCP and UDP Support**: Netbyte supports both TCP and UDP protocols, enabling versatile networking operations.
- **Formatted Output**: The tool provides formatted output, enhancing readability and usability.

## Usage
Netbyte can be used for a variety of networking tasks, including:
- Probing services to check for open ports
- Testing network connectivity
- Transferring files over TCP/IP connections
- Sending commands to remote hosts

## Installation
